# Assignment4

The application is launched from the main method of facade.UserInterface. Although I was able to get the interpreter design pattern working and the iterator working, I couldn't get them implemented in the main program without breaking other modules. I provided main functions in iterator.Client and interpreter.YahooExpression to demonstrate those patterns. I did incorporate a translation function that works in the main application, but it requires more work to get it the way I wanted it.

I also took suggestions about the use of static methods in the Singleton Logger and added a Scanner Reader as a Singleton.
